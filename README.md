# Regression Models

This repository contains implementations of various regression models using Python. Each model is explained with code, theoretical background, and practical applications.

## Included Regression Models

### 1. Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares - OLS)
- Implements simple linear regression using the OLS method.
- Computes model parameters using the closed-form solution.
- Evaluates model performance using R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Includes visualization of the regression line.

### 2. Polynomial Regression
- Extends linear regression to capture non-linear relationships.
- Uses polynomial features to transform input variables.
- Evaluates the model using R² and MSE.
- Provides visualization of polynomial fits.

### 3. Ridge Regression
- Regularized version of linear regression to prevent overfitting.
- Introduces an L2 penalty term.
- Demonstrates tuning of the regularization parameter (alpha).
- Evaluates performance with cross-validation.

### 4. Lasso Regression
- Similar to Ridge Regression but with an L1 penalty.
- Can perform feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero.
- Shows impact of different values of alpha.

### 5. Elastic Net Regression
- Combination of L1 and L2 regularization.
- Useful when dealing with correlated features.
- Demonstrates how different mixing ratios affect the model.

### 6. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Uses Support Vector Machines for regression tasks.
- Handles non-linearity using kernel functions.
- Includes examples using linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels.

### 7. Decision Tree Regression
- Non-parametric model based on decision trees.
- Demonstrates tree depth control to avoid overfitting.
- Compares results with linear models.

### 8. Random Forest Regression
- Ensemble learning approach using multiple decision trees.
- Shows impact of number of estimators on performance.
- Evaluates model generalization.

### 9. Gradient Boosting Regression
- Boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially to improve accuracy.
- Demonstrates hyperparameter tuning.
- Includes performance comparisons with Random Forest.
